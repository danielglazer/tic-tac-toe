Here's the task:
Design a Tic Tac Toe API + server implementation, requirements:
1. Users can create a game.
2. Users can join a game.
3. Users can place their piece on the board (X,Y).
4. The game will end if a user won / there are no more moves with a status (won/lost/tie) per the requesting player.
5. There should be a status API that returns (X/Y won, Tie, Playing).

Javascript is ok, Typescript is preferred.
A naive implementation is ok, we can discuss further enhancements later.


How to run(commands for windows/linux machine): 
git clone the project (require git to be installed)
cd server
npm i (require npm to be installed)
you will also need to have mongodb instance running locally on the default port

How to test:
via postman on port 3000

exposed rest endpoints:
createGame: 
  url-example: http://localhost:3000/games/
  method: Post,
  body: {}
  response-example: 8fcadc65-3884-4c8b-89a5-c74e2fb24bc2
joinGame:
  url-example: http://localhost:3000/games/8fcadc65-3884-4c8b-89a5-c74e2fb24bc2
  method: Put,
  body: {
    "displayName": "string",
    "shape": "X"
  }
  response-example: 
makeMove:
  url-example: http://localhost:3000/games/8fcadc65-3884-4c8b-89a5-c74e2fb24bc2/move
  method: Put,
  body: {
    "x": 1,
    "y": 1
  }
  response-example: 
getGameStatus:
  url-example: http://localhost:3000/games/8fcadc65-3884-4c8b-89a5-c74e2fb24bc2/status
